What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary Tests
mywc001.txt: contains nothing, should return 0, 0, 0
mywc002.txt: only contains new lines, but no spaces
mywc003.txt: random characters
mywc004.txt: just a simple one liner
mywc005.txt: alternate new lines
mywc006.txt: alternate spaces

Statement Tests
mywcproberbmodified.txt iterates through the program and hits every statement. Since it does not end with space, new line, or tab character, it correctedly does statement 53 to finish the word count.

Stress Tests
mywcStressTest.txt: stresses the program by printing 50000 random characters
mywcStressTest2.txt: stresses the program by printing 1000 lines

What are the CPU times consumed by the programs from Parts 2a, 2b, 2d,
2e, and 2f to compute fib(250000) on armlab? Fill in the blanks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Study the given code. Then build a fib program consisting of the files fib.c, bigint.c, and bigintadd.c, with no optimizations (that is, without the -D NDEBUG option and without the -O option, as described below). Run the program to compute fib(250000). In your readme file note the amount of CPU time consumed.
